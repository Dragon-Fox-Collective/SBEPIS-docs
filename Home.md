Welcome to the SBEPIS wiki!

SBEPIS is a fan-made, first-person implementation of "SBURB," the game from Andrew Hussie's web comic _Homestuck_. The goal of SBEPIS is to complete several hard tasks that other SBURB sims haven't done, such as comprehensive AI and procedural alchemy.
SBEPIS is in _Pre-Alpha_ and _does not_ have a timeline for full release. Information within the wiki is not exhaustive and is subject to change at any point.
