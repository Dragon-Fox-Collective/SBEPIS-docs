Aesthetic tags can describe the appearance, bonuses, and non-aspect related powers of an object within an item card. The number of tags is limited, although by what measure is undecided. Importantly, aesthetic tags can have a magnitude of 0 - 100. Aesthetic tags also define physical properties, such as weight or density, and combined with the tag magnitude, will also comprise a key function within the physics system. Each tag has its own grist cost, with the upper limit cost corresponding with a magnitude of 100.

This list is an in-progress list of aesthetic tags that have been planned for SBEPIS.
