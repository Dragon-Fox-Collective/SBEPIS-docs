Diagetically, the players control their characters by taking the place of carapacian exiles, feeding prompts through a terminal, although as direct movement inputs. Also as diagetically, the players may control these exiles a layer of terminal removed. This is where most pause menu functionality goes. Additionally, when the player is controlling their exile, their character becomes controlled by [[Values|AI]] as to not interrupt gameplay for everyone else involved.
