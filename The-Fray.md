The Fray is a reactive timing system throughout the game, influencing other core mechanics, such as combat and dialogue. The Fray can be affected in or out of combat, and is the main system that the time aspect will interact with. The Fray is client-side, meaning that unless players are in the same battle, they will rarely interact with the same Fray.

## Beats
Spaces of time in a Meter of Combat, used to measure if a player is keeping Rhythm with the Meter and Tempo of Combat. Light Attacks are Quarter Beats, Heavy Attacks are Half Beats, and Special Attacks are Full Beats. Dialogue options will also be composed of Beats. Length of Beats will shift to match a combatants individual Time Signature.

## Rhythm
Our means of tracking how closely the playerâ€™s Beats match the Tempo and Time Signatures of a Meter. Keeping Rhythm does not require attacking exactly on the Beat of The Fray, but matching the Tempo is required to get a bonus to Mana Regeneration and bonus Gel Viscosity Damage

### Polyrhythms
Having different Time Signatures within a single Meter is considered a Polyrhythm, as long as Tempo is matched to the overall 4/4 Rhythm of Combat, we can treat beats on Tempo as correct. A Polyrhythm audible in The Fray, denotes a battle for ownership over The Fray. 

### Fighting Off-Rhythm
Fighting Off Rhythm serves the purpose of shifting control of The Fray. If you attack an opponent Off Rhythm, it can force them to respond in ways that shake them into fighting in a different Time Signature or Tempo than they would be when Controlling or Fighting In The Fray. The more an opponent fights Off Rhythm, the more they lose Control of The Fray. After reaching a certain threshold, this will transfer control to the next most Rhythmic combatant. This makes those who do not have a good sense of rhythm out of play still serve an important role in shaking up the battlefield.

## Time Signature
The amount of Beats a combatant leans for in a Meter. Will reference their Genre and Goal. This means that combatants will TEND to fight on a beat unless fighting reactively or attempting to throw an opponent Off Rhythm.

## Genre
The attacks non-player combatants will execute on Beats and how the Beats relate to the Time Signature and Tempo of The Fray. Personality traits and combat style can have an affect on Genre.

## Tempo
The speed of a Meter of Combat. Paced by the strongest fighter(s) as they Own The Fray. Desperation, intensity, difficulty, and proximity to a timespace chunk all correlate positively with Tempo. Tempo can also be increased during arguments, chases, or escapes.

## Meter
The amount of a round of Combat, evenly split into Beats based on a Time Signature. Some characters will speak in certain Meters.
