# Momentum

Generally, momentum is conserved and requires input or friction to cancel out or redirect. Redirecting momentum by turning is not instant and has a certain turning radius.

# Dash

A dash occurs when the dash button is tapped. It redirects all momentum and moves the player at a constant velocity.

# Dodge

A dodge occurs when the dash button is held. It increases the control of momentum, so the turning radius of redirecting momentum is finer, and decreases the player's momentum down to a cap. Holding input toward your momentum loses less of it. Holding input adverse to your momentum dramatically decreases momentum, like an emergency break.

Dodges are affected little by the environment.

If the player is on the ground, this is a slide. If the player is in the air, this is a roll.

# Stamina

"Hubris"

Dashing uses stamina. Attempting to perform dash actions while having no stamina and having little momentum causes the player to trip.

While sprinting does not decrease stamina, having low stamina prevents sprinting.

Dash-attacking refills stamina, to keep attack momentum going.

# Roly-Poly

BALL FORME

Rolling is affected greatly by the environment, but has very little friction.

# Tripping

Tripping causes you to become slightly airborne and stunned. If you press crouch when you land, you tech into a slide with a burst of momentum and increased hubris (GROUND PARRY). If you run out of stun frames while in the air, you'll probably want to immediately go into a roly-poly to redirect momentum.

Falling at a high velocity causes you to go into the trip/flail state.

# Charge

While charging, jumping causes a higher jump, higher than the high jump. Charging a dash causes a faster dash.

## UNREAL AIR

Performing a high jump when charged causes a charged high jump.

# Enemy Lock-on

When locked onto an enemy, dashing brings the player directly to them at a set time according to the fray.

# Long Jump

When land at high speeds, instead of tripping, or when sliding, the player may jump while holding forward to preserve or redirect momentum as if they bounce off of it.

# Backflip

When land at high speeds, instead of tripping, or when sliding, the player may jump while holding forward to redirect momentum vertically relative to the normal of the surface.
