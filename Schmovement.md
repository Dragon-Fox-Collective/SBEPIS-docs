# Momentum

Generally, momentum is conserved and requires input or friction to cancel out or redirect. Redirecting momentum by turning is not instant and has a certain turning radius.

# Dash

A dash occurs when the dash button is tapped. It grants an immediate boost in speed and momentum in the chosen direction.

# Dodge

A dodge occurs when the dash button is held. It increases the control of momentum, so the turning radius of redirecting momentum is finer, and decreases momentum to the maximum dodge velocity of the player, give or take some due to slopes. Holding input adverse to your momentum dramatically decreases momentum, like an emergency break. Holding dodge with no direction input makes the player slippery.

Holding the crouch button while dodging gives even more control at the cost of more momentum loss.

If the player is on the ground, this is a slide. If the player is in the air, this is a roll.

# Stamina

"Hubris"

Dashing uses stamina. Attempting to perform dash actions while having no stamina and having little momentum causes the player to trip.

While sprinting does not decrease stamina, having low stamina prevents sprinting.

Dash-attacking refills stamina, to keep attack momentum going.

# Roly-Poly

BALL FORME

# Tripping

Tripping causes you to become slightly airborne and stunned. If you press crouch when you land, you tech into a slide with a burst of momentum and increased hubris (GROUND PARRY). If you run out of stun frames while in the air, you'll probably want to immediately go into a roly-poly to redirect momentum.

# Charge

While charging, jumping causes a higher jump, higher than the high jump. Charging a dash causes a faster dash.

## UNREAL AIR

Performing a high jump when charged causes a charged high jump.
