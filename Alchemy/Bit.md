A bit is one of 48 pieces of data represented by holes punched in an item card. These bits correspond to attributes that, together, define the base functions of an item. An item with no bits is a Perfectly Generic Object, although an object with no bits may still have [[Tag|tags]]. Bits are listed in no particular order.

| Bit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Handled | Able to be grabbed or wielded by objects with Interacting bits. |
| Pointed | Comes to a point or is able to pierce objects. |
| Edged | Comes to an edge or is able to cut objects. |
| Decorative | _Undefined or Self-Explanatory_ |
| Launched | _Undefined or Self-Explanatory_ |
| Aerodynamic | Shaped in such a way that movement through fluids is optimized. |

| Logic | Object has “logic,” either as a simple machine or a complex mind. |
| Jointed | Has one or more articulated joints. |
| Identity | Object is housing a soul or splinter, objects can allude to a soul by being owned by a soul, but more common examples are lil Cal and AR. |
| Interacting | Object interacts with other objects directly, used for machines, hands, and bodies. |
| Standing | Marks an object as standing a certain distance above the ground, such as legs. |
| Recursive | Marks object as having repeating aspects of its design. |
| Liquid | Is liquid or able to make something wet. |
| Heated | Is hot or able to set something on fire. |
| Cold | Is cold or able to freeze something. |
| Energized | Is powered or able to transfer power. |
| Conductive | Contains and transfers power to anything it touches that is able to conduct. |
| Luminescent | Is bright and able to create light, potential AOE implications? |
| Bifurcated | Splits into 2 or is able to split. |
| Doubled | Is 2 things or able to double something. |
| Halved | Is half of something or able to halve an object. |
| Mirrored | Mirrored on either end or able to mirror. |
| Collection | Is able to collect and contain similar things? |
| Secondary | _Undefined or Self-Explanatory_ |
| Tethered | Connects via a tether, rope, or chain. |
| Flattened | Flat, like a platform, paddle, or plank. |
| Hollow | Able to contain things as it does not, used for clothing, containers, and cases. |
| Mobile | Able to move or interacts with mobility |
| Mechanized | Is a machine, requires power to live. |
| Attaching | Connects objects together, glue, welding guns, and workstations. |
| Viewing | Is able to detect things it sees. |
| Triggered | Buttons, levers, and a toggle option to an object. |
| Informative | Contains or provides information related to the roleplay system. Guardian notes, personal computers, and time keeping devices. |
| Living | Is alive and requires needs to be met to survive. |
| Musical | Is able to play or produce music. Interacts with tempo and fraymotif systems. |
| Edible | Is able to be consumed safely or digested, regardless of palatability or sensibility. |
| Fragile | Able to be broken with ease |
| Attractive | Pulls things towards it like gravity or magnets. |
| Body | The centre of mass and main body of an object. |
| Protective | Protects other things from harm and blocks damage at its own expense. |
| Flammable | Able to be set on fire/explode. |
| Supportive | Supports a structure from inside or between major forms. Used for skeletons and scaffolds. |

Bits are still subject to change.

# Bit Sets

A bit set is able to define emergent properties of objects with certain combinations of bits. Below are some of the bit sets so far.

| Original Bits                   | Emergent Bits                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Logic + Viewing                 | Observing                    |
| Logic + Identity                | Sentience                    |
| Standing + Jointed + Living     | Legs/Feet                    |
| Interacting + Jointed + Living  | Arms/Hands                   |
| Standing + Jointed + Mechanized | Prosthetic/Robotic Legs/Feet |
| Hollow + Gaseous                | Aerated                      |
| Aerodynamic + Handled           | Thrown                       |
| Aerodynamic + Liquid            | Aquatic                      |
| Propulsive + Hollow             | Loaded                       |
| Energized + Flammable           | Explosive                    |
| Decorative + Hollow             | Clothing                     |

Bit sets are also, naturally, subject to change.
