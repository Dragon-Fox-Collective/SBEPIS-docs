A tag holds arbitrary data about an object. These can be created through [[Bit|bits]] (called bit tags), but also through item card data. For instance, a PGO has no bits, but does have the Green tag, which can be inherited. Tags may also contain information relating to the original item base. Tags can be oppositional or synergistic. Tags retain memories of what created that item, discouraging alchemical loops.
# Aesthetic Tag

Aesthetic tags are a type of tag that can describe the appearance, bonuses, and non-aspect related powers of an object within an item card. The number of these tags is limited, although by what measure is undecided. Importantly, aesthetic tags can have a magnitude of 0 - 100. Aesthetic tags also define physical properties, such as weight or density, and combined with the tag magnitude, will also comprise a key function within the physics system. Each tag has its own grist cost, with the upper limit cost corresponding with a magnitude of 100.

This list is an in-progress list of aesthetic tags that have been planned for SBEPIS.

| Tag       | Description | Cost |
| --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| Harlequin | x           | x    |
| Wizard    | x           | x    |
| Cat       | x           | x    |
| Crow      | x           | x    |
