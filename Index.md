Welcome to the SBEPIS documentation!

SBEPIS is a fan-made, first-person implementation of "SBURB," the game from Andrew Hussie's web comic _Homestuck_. The goal of SBEPIS's development is to complete several hard tasks that other SBURB sims haven't done, such as comprehensive AI and procedural alchemy.
SBEPIS is in _Pre-Alpha_ and _does not_ have a timeline for full release. Information within the documentation is not exhaustive and is subject to change at any point. 

Join the SBEPIS [Discord](https://discord.gg/qHREQu7Zxm)! Developer streams, news, and discussions can be found there, as well as an active community of _Homestuck_ fans, furries, and gamers! It's also the best place to give feedback, support, ideas, or ask questions!
