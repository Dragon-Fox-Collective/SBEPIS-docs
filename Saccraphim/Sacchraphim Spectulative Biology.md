> The Sacchraphim are a celestial serpentine species with a complex relationship regarding death and life. Their organs and reproductive habits call to mind more plant based or cephalopod tendencies however, being hard to kill intelligent regenerative creatures that produce parasitic young mostly at the cost of their own life.

## Life Cycle & Reproduction
______

This is a single sex species that undergoes rapid parthenogenesis and asexual reproduction to increase their population. Whenever they are producing young, they are driven to undergo a trigger happy hyper-aggressive state. Make no mistake this is not an angry rage, this is joyous bloodlust. During this time whenever they are killed, their spores will spill out of their body and begin germinating. They can spill out from any body part including bone. These spores appear candylike in appearance. If the Sacchraphim isn’t malnourished and is carrying spores, if it isn’t killed or dies in time due to external forces, the spores will begin to germinate inside the carrier and eat their way out of them. Whenever a gravid Sacchraphim dies due to internal/natural reasons rather than external/unnatural it will result in a still birth. The most fertile Sacchraphim will produce the largest and most numerous amount of young and fertility is akin to a need like hunger except for if the creature completely cannot produce spores.

> "Candy" drops when they die
> They appear to take on all colors of the individual's body, including retinas.

Sacchraphim are edible for majority of sapient beings in the universe and are actually pretty nutritious due to their ravenous varied diet and detoxing systems internally. Eating one however, would definitely kill you. It would take a differing amount of time depending on the fertility of the specimen but eating raw spores would be the fastest way to be eaten alive from the inside as they hatch tiny Sacchraphim, stimulated by both the chemical reactions of your body and your very soul. Eating spores created by a still birth would still kill you, the young are dead make no mistake, but the sheer amount of energy they carry inside them would decimate your body. If for whatever reason your body could handle the energy, your fate would likely be sealed by infection as they begin to rot inside your bloodstream and organs. 

After germinating, the spores will hatch and produce disproportionately sized and shaped young and this is one per spore. They vary in shapes and sizes depending on the virility and strength of their parent. This can be either a droplet shape, a bean shape or a worm-like shape. They posses a ball shaped head in order to protect the developing organs in it before their chitin takes on psuedo-facial features, however the rest of the body should be tough enough to protect the organs there. These protections are purely vestigial and aren’t enough to stand against against most adults who do cannibalize any young they find, most functions of the creature that aren’t orientated around killing or reproducing more efficiently are relics from a hazy time in pre-history. 

Maturity occurs once all digestive systems and regenerative 
systems are done growing, with communicative methods becoming more and more varied as the individual gets older and older. This is so that they can create more intricate courting displays towards one another to relay more and more information about the health, age, fertility and fitness of the individual. Funnily enough, their intelligence grows the older they get past maturity as well eventually reaching omnipotent or clairvoyant capacities as a celestial race.

## Coloration
_____

They come in many ranges of color that all follow the same rule set, there aren’t subspecies or morphs in the traditional sense. There are three colors on the body of a Sacchraphim not counting the rest of the body:

- The color of compact bones & chitin
- The Seclera & epidermis
- The Retina, keratin & soft flesh
- Pupils can range from white or black, this seems to be random genetics akin to humans and not determinative of anything

All other naturally grown additions to the body, such as fangs or new limbs and in rarer cases organs would and should adhere to these rules unless it’s a special exception.

![[SCHRM0.png]]

## Infertility & Mutations
___
### Infertility 
An infertile individual won’t posses a skull. As they lack the image of death, they are effectively immortal and cannot die which in turn means they cannot produce young. This is rare in Sacchraphim and individuals who don’t die sometimes do not ever learn why they cannot die. These rare exceptions can grow to enormous proportions and keep on growing forever if they do not grow bored of granting their kin the wish of death and joy. It's generally considered the more fertile you are, the more elaborate your chitinous displays are. 
### Monochromatic Color Schemes 
Purely monochromatic color schemes (Ranging from just black and white, black white and gray, black white and one other color, gray and white etc etc) are practically unheard of. Their iridescence simply becomes illuminance as it can’t convey any other color hues, more akin to a metallic sheen than an oil spill.
### Inverted Color Schemes
Sometimes called crème brûlée color schemes, this is when white occurs in place of the black/dark tinged colors of the body itself. This creates a pearlescent effect on the lower body. In contrast to the average Sacchraphim, the skull and eyes take on dark colors as well and effectively cause the creature to look “Inverted” in color.

#### Other mutations that don’t typically ever occur are:

| Mutation Name                     | Description                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Gelato”                          | when the body of the creature is pastel.                                                                          |
| “Sorbetto”                        | Vibrantly colored bodies following the color of the seclera.                                                      |
| “Sundae”                          | Possessing of a black/dark colored skull & bones.                                                                 |
| Sprinkle”                         | the seclera and body are black                                                                                    |
| “Cake”                            | when the creature has a dual or single colored palette instead of three                                           |
| “Fried Ice Cream”                 | when the retina and soft flesh is a black/dark color creating a “swirling” effect.                                |
| “Neapolitan” or “Creamsicle”      | Possessing of white chitin, seclera or retinas.                                                                   |
| “Mocchi Eyes”  or "Mooncake Eyes" | Wherein the eyes specifically only possess 1 or 2 colors, creating a blind or human appearing eye akin to a moon. |
| “Bombe”                           | when the iridescence of the creature is enough to make it look holographic or color changing instead of subtle.   |

> This monochromatic, infertile specimen is currently the only individual with any of these mutations are known to exist. 

## Skin
___

Whilst their soft tissue takes on the bizarre one of hues they’re most well known for, creating an array of color when killed, their outer skin is almost inky black in appearance. In the depths of space, it would be very difficult to spot this part of the body if not for the oily iridescence that occurs on it. This iridescence tends to take on the hues of the Sclera of the creature. It’s the thick blubbery outer skin has a velvety texture to it and it's almost as if it should be slimy or underwater but it’s completely dry. Some Sacchraphim use this to belly slide similar to a penguin.

![[SCHRM1.png]]

## The Skulls
__________
They possess a chitinous covering around the actual head that protects a number of very delicate sensory organs, this covering is skull shaped and varies in transparency, they are never completely see through. As the Sacchraphim are very visual creatures, they require very fine tuned observational and communicative focused organs when interacting with others from their kind in order to determine information like fertility. It’s considered a very romantic gesture to aid someone in increasing their fertility by helping them find food to increase their spore count, so judging things like this about your companion is very important indeed! As well as co-ordinating group births or festivities, knowing everything you can in order to prepare for the next harvest is vital. 

The Skulls and the amount and shape of fangs or even claws can vary a little but never stray outside certain perimeters. Skulls themselves stay specifically within the vein of humanoid, specifically predatory reptile shaped skulls. Fangs can range from tiny canines to sabers and tusks and be numerous but all the teeth shapes contribute to the need of eating meat as their tongue can break down plant matter, they use the teeth for other Sacchraphim or live food, their material is different than the skull and appears almost chalky. Claws aren’t on every individual but aren’t too special of a development, some are missing any chitin on their extremities entirely. The claws can vary from fingernails, therizinosaurus styled claws, insectoid fingertips etc.

## Abilities & Extra Limbs
________
In regards to limb growth and how this affects them, it is all too common to see these creatures grow a quite frankly unreasonable array of limbs to then shed them and half of their body mass in order to progress in their goal of spreading joyous carnage around their galactic neighborhood. Finding a choir/Confectionary of Sacchraphim means finding a lot of visceral, corpses and straight up disposed limbs. Prepare for the weirdly enticing smells and the really disturbing urge to feed on whatever weird possibly toxic material is on the floor now. The older a Sacchraphim is the more complex limbs they can create, newly hatched Sacchraphim tend to use rudimentary limbs more as they cost less energy to create. They can only regrow and sustain these limbs by feeding enough however. Even if they are satiated in immediate hunger they won’t stop feeding until their other stomachs, where their digestive system is advanced enough to dissolve things immensely quickly, are full. The average length of a Sacchraphim has space for the main stomach and then 2 “Overflow/Overclock” stomachs, the longer the spine of the Sacchraphim is, likely the more stomach and storage organs it’ll have. The stomachs convert any and all food or water into fuel that the body can use to produce immense amounts of energy and heat for the spontaneous growth of these limbs. The limbs they can create aren’t sensory limbs at all, they’re exclusively locomotive, for example:

- Wings
- Tentacles
- Arms
- Legs
- Flippers

Aside from these locomotive limbs, they can fly regardless if they actually have wings or not in that moment. When not using this ability they use movement reminiscent of snakes and sea snake with some individuals being seen adopting a side winder or a Gabon adder’s methods of movement. When flying they’re ribbon-like and fluid with faster propelled movements reminiscent of dolphins and fish the most common if they’re not contorting whatever way they feel like. Natural markings following the color palette of the Sacchraphim show up a lot more obviously when they’re able to create a new limb in that area, these markings can pulse and glow akin to how some squid or cuttlefish do when they’re super stimulated and depending on a lot of factors it can communicate what emotions they’re expressing to those around them. These are sort of hard to see when they’re off but they become more obvious, not necessarily saturated, as the Sacchraphim is more satiated in hunger.

## Further Shape Manipulation
___

Sacchraphim can take on a more humanoid, gangly shape and posses a digitigrade stance. This shape has wings and a tail as well, it appears as if it’s floating but it’s actually attached by a single thick tendril that is prehensile to better direct flight even if they don’t necessarily need to be adept fliers with their aforementioned ability to fly regardless. This shape is really malleable, to the point they can fold themselves into pretzels. They still have their skull but their neck below appears more human until the spine shifts or stretches, akin to owls. They can still reproduce in this form in any capacity.

>Using the same monochromatic specimen as before, the difference between an infertile and a fertile individual are depicted.
## Culture 
_____

Their culture is one of celebration of life and death and how intrinsic they are to one another. In their world, life is death and death is life because of how they reproduce and so they do not understand why most other species in the universe are constantly in a battle of the fittest.

Typically, the Sacchraphim are an intense species to interact with as they’re constantly attempting to learn about the other being they’re interacting or attempting to reproduce. This means that they’re effectively either communicating, LOUDLY, or about to assassinate them. They adore all the vibrant colors of the rainbow as those are all the colors possible that a Sacchraphim can have on their bodies. Slapstick comedy is the height of comedy to them. 

Whilst participating in the super special festivities isn’t expected of everyone, constantly watching the events and never actually entering the arena to take part yourself is considered a perverse behavior. 

There isn’t really a stigma around when you die, as long as you do it. Sometimes there are those who plan out their deaths to a t whereas others want something spontaneous, fantasizing about it is akin to humans fantasizing about love and marriage. Older specimens are desired as much as others, super fertile or not entirely fertile specimens are too. As long as they’re consenting to the act of death and are actually mature enough to produce, killing one another is a bonding experience to be celebrated. Killing those who aren’t mature to feed or express another form of love is valid in a different way as romantic love isn’t the only one they celebrate, in a way their way of life is just as much about parenthood and familial love. Sacchraphim confectionaries think of each individual in the collective as connected to one enough through the love their sharing, as such everyone is family to the sugarush emotionally in a similar yet emotionally more open way than most human ideas of tribal or village community. As such all actions percieved as affectionate or loving are deeply integral to every part of their culture. 

The Sacchraphim are an opportunistic species, as such it’s very common to find them absorbing things into their culture whilst only taking the rudimentary meaning behind it (they have no media literacy unless they have a lot of intelligence). They love combining things due to the chaotic nature of their reproduction, it fascinates them that two things could combine and create something that is both things at once instead of completely identical to another. Things like instruments tend to be involved with weapon manufacture, though they have many biological weapons, as the sound of music provides a lot of amusement and entertainment. Clothes also are scavenged from around their territory as such when applying decorative clothing or armor it’s often mismatched and to the nines, fashion shows are very much an all inclusive event with the criteria of what the craziest thing you can convince others is actually clothes.

### Teacher role Place holder

The last sacchraphim in that generation will become a teacher It’s a shameful role Education Every class is a massive university lecture They love consuming deep space radiation It’s how they produce so many young grow so quickly 

## Markings
__________

Face paint, make up and general body paint are a staple of this species after reaction maturity; it’s a way of conveying individuality. *(Yes you can tell I come from this lineage, but rather than this person I am this person!)* The paints are created by a lot of methods and to an extent its iconography and application is entirely up to the individual. You can see trends within specific palettes/plates. The most common by far is black but it’s not especially rare to see white either, muted colors can be used too but aren’t too popular. Colors are another thing that’s up to the individual and the resources they have available. There are some who have discovered substances they can use as paints that glow or are otherwise interesting in appearance and use those. These markings typically aren’t extensive or in blocks and mainly accent features. Painting on the body itself can be immensely intimidating in the arena for some.

## Theories on Origin
__________

There are theories on their origin, however it is very unclear and is still debated. The two most widely accepted are as such:

### Theory 1:

The Sacchraphim are a progenitor race to the Cherubs, they at least belong to the same family tree as them. Previously in history they existed across universes, in the “wild” and ran rampant due to overpopulation and eradication of other species they came into contact with. They favored doomed timelines to spend the most time in with other members of their species or sister species as well.

One day they came across another race and eventually got onto friendly terms with them, though this would eventually turn sour after members of the two attempted to reproduce with one another (both completely misunderstanding what the other meant by that) and resulting in the other species containing the Sacchraphim in an isolated timeline or pocket dimension to protect reality. Something within this contained space occurred that completely upended the previous biology of the species and resulted in a handful of once Sacchraphim now Cherubs escaping as hateful ♣️ beings instead of the once affectionate ♥️ creatures they once were.

### Theory 2:

Conversely, another theory believes that the Cherubs created the Sacchraphim as a livestock species. This would explain their volatile existence and how easily it can spiral out of control (overpopulation, complete annihilation of ecosystems and biospheres etc etc). Cherubs are currently the only species in existence that can safely consume a Sacchraphim in any shape or form without any danger, they’re able to completely break down the Sacchraphim and absorb the energy from that break down without problem. 

There is a possibility they also use this ability as a weapon, eating Sacchraphim and then infecting non-Cherub enemies with the spores to guarantee their death.
