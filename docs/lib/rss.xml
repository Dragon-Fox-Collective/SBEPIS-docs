 <br>Alchemy is a core mechanic within SBEPIS.<br>In SBEPIS, items are stored within item cards. Items have identifiers correlating to when a player “discovered” the recipe.<br><br>An item card contains bits, defined by any of 48 holes punched in the card, and tags, defined by the qualities of the item stored inside the card. A card with no holes always contains a Perfectly Generic Object, or PGO. Bits contain information about an item’s basic function or type, such as the Handled(H) bit, which denotes an item with a component able to be wielded by players.<br><br>Some bit combinations add emergent tags.<br><br>Tags, contained within item cards, correspond to qualities about an item. These can be defined through bits (called bit tags), but also through item card data. For instance, a PGO has no bits, and thus no bit tags, but does have the Green tag, which can be inherited. Tags may also contain information relating to the original item base. Tags can be oppositional or synergistic. There may only be a certain number of tags on an item at once. Tags retain memories of what created that item, discouraging alchemical loops.<br><br>Other than bit tags are aesthetic tags, which, unlike bit tags, have a scale from 0 - 100 that determines how strongly an item inherits the traits associated with the tag. When two items are combined, the averages of tags is calculated, rounding down into whole numbers. Alchemizing an item with an item in its hereditary tree returns the same tag value. The more prominent a tag is, the more parts might be exchanged. Tags have aesthetic and form components, and perhaps materials affect things like weight and buoyancy, although minorly. As a tag gets higher or stronger, it gains secondary abilities, such as damage increases. Aspect tags are the important parts of this. Aspect tags will give an item an aspect power when strong enough.]]></description><link>https://dragon-fox-collective.github.io/SBEPIS-docs/alchemy/alchemy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Alchemy/Alchemy.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dragon & Fox Collective]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 17:36:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bit]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The number of these tags is limited, although by what measure is undecided. Importantly, aesthetic tags can have a magnitude of 0 - 100. Aesthetic tags also define physical properties, such as weight or density, and combined with the tag magnitude, will also comprise a key function within the physics system. Each tag has its own grist cost, with the upper limit cost corresponding with a magnitude of 100.<br>This list is an in-progress list of aesthetic tags that have been planned for SBEPIS.<br>]]></description><link>https://dragon-fox-collective.github.io/SBEPIS-docs/alchemy/tag.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Alchemy/Tag.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dragon & Fox Collective]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 17:36:51 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Training Dummy]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Projectile weapons only shoot when using piercing attacks. Directional attacks would be swinging the gun.

Innate movement encompasses running, sprinting, jumping, crouching, and sliding… Satisfactory-style crouch bhopping is also innate.

<br>Special attacks are used when weapons are not locked on to a target (reloads, special attacks, other misc actions) Uses your current movement to do a certain attack.
<br>Piercing attacks are from the camera forwards– IE, non directional movement. Imagine a sword jab vs an arced attack. Instead of calculating armor, you’re looking for weak points/unarmored points. 
<br>Light attacks (for projectiles, this is shooting), they’re always forward facing/ cannot be directional
<br>Heavy attacks will be directional. They can influence direction while attacking, unlike special attacks, which only account for direction, not change it.
<br>Combinations of bits will assign a weapon a strife specibus type, which thus determines the function of light/heavy/special attacks
<br><br>
<br>Directional Attacks have 27 variations (Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Up, Down, All Diagonals and Not Moving)
<br>Parts have Gel Viscosity that can be depleted to deal a crit. If a crit on a 0 GV part kills the target, a gib system will be activated.

<br><br><br>The Commander is, for all intents and purposes, a boss within a combat scenario. Because bosses will be diverse, the play style efficiency will depend on the boss. Commanders within an event chunk will have levels of importance. Lower importance means lower chances of successfully commanding a swarm.

Limited AI with seeded randomness.<br>Examples of Swarmers include:<br>
<br>Imps: Do not carry items but will have mutations. Faction leader is the Denizen.
<br>Basilisks, Liches, Giclopses, Ogres
<br>Carapacians: Equipment loadouts AND mutations
<br>Consorts: Do not mutate without Commander Intervention. Carry items and equipment loadouts.
<br><br>Combat begins when both parties are aware of an encounter. Teams are generated depending on the initiate parties.<br><br>Key choice made by evaluation of enemies, factions, power, tempo, etc.<br>A combat event will conclude with an end condition, either the death of the aggressor party or target party, the satiation of the aggressor party (calmed) or the target party (spared), fleeing, knock-out.<br>
<br>Fleeing - Extra damage against fleeing targets
<br>Knocked Out - Attacks kill knocked out targets
<br><br>What’s the goal of abjuration?<br>
<br>Dialogue - Dialogue abjuration will involve a defensive playstyle and quick dialogue choices. The goal of this must also be determined, but it can usually be assumed the goal is non-violent resolution and higher relationship and factional relationship.
<br>Knockout - Goal of this is non-lethal defeat of enemies. Enemies will not be killed when defeated. This can be for a variety of tactical reasons.
<br><br>Tactical escapes, enemies will give chase! What’s the best way to leave?<br>
<br>Will the enemy type give chase? Are you a target?
<br>What abilities do enemies have compared to players? Teleports?
<br>Is there a team looking for you now? Will this affect factional relationships? Regular relationships? Increase importance?
<br><br>The goal is to kill, the question is how?<br>
<br>Team Numbers - Are we outnumbered? By how much?
<br>Presence of Commanders - Will the commanders also be killed? (combat stance related,) Are the enemies organized or disorganized?
<br>Enemy types - What types of damage will be most effective?
<br><br>Teams are created on battle start, but are also dynamic within an event chunk. Team placement will depend on various factors, such as faction relationships, player relationships, strife choice, and targets of attack. <br>Combatants involved in a combat event will be determined by how many combatants are within the event chunk. The event chunk will read the Time value depending on the combatants within the chunk and their time-related abilities. When an event chunk contains no combatants that have time-related abilities, only the SCT time will be read.<br>
Teams will include aggressor parties and target parties initially, and each of these teams will have defined intents to kill.]]></description><link>https://dragon-fox-collective.github.io/SBEPIS-docs/combat.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Combat.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Dragon & Fox Collective]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jun 2024 16:41:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Index]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Welcome to the SBEPIS documentation!<br>SBEPIS is a fan-made, first-person implementation of "SBURB," the game from Andrew Hussie's web comic Homestuck. The goal of SBEPIS's development is to complete several hard tasks that other SBURB sims haven't done, such as comprehensive AI and procedural alchemy.<br>
SBEPIS is in Pre-Alpha and does not have a timeline for full release.
