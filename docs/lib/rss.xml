 <br>Welcome to the SBEPIS wiki!<br>SBEPIS is a fan-made, first-person implementation of "SBURB," the game from Andrew Hussie's web comic Homestuck. The goal of SBEPIS is to complete several hard tasks that other SBURB sims haven't done, such as comprehensive AI and procedural alchemy.<br>
SBEPIS is in Pre-Alpha and does not have a timeline for full release.

 <br>Aesthetic tags are a type of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Alchemy > Tags" data-href="Alchemy#Tags" href="alchemy.html#Tags" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">tag</a> can describe the appearance, bonuses, and non-aspect related powers of an object within an item card. The number of tags is limited, although by what measure is undecided. Importantly, aesthetic tags can have a magnitude of 0 - 100. Aesthetic tags also define physical properties, such as weight or density, and combined with the tag magnitude, will also comprise a key function within the physics system. Each tag has its own grist cost, with the upper limit cost corresponding with a magnitude of 100.<br>This list is an in-progress list of aesthetic tags that have been planned for SBEPIS.<br>]]></description><link>aesthetic-tags.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Aesthetic Tags.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 21:38:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[<a data-href="Bits" href="bits.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Bits</a>]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Alchemy is a core mechanic within SBEPIS.<br>In SBEPIS, items are stored within item cards. Items have identifiers correlating to when a player “discovered” the recipe.<br><br>An item card contains bits, defined by any of 48 holes punched in the card, and tags, defined by the qualities of the item stored inside the card. A card with no holes always contains a Perfectly Generic Object, or PGO. Bits contain information about an item’s basic function or type, such as the Handled(H) bit, which denotes an item with a component able to be grabbed by players.<br><br>Some bit combinations add emergent tags.<br><br>Tags, contained within item cards, correspond to qualities about an item. These can be defined through bits (called bit tags), but also through item card data. For instance, a PGO has no bits, and thus no bit tags, but does have the Green tag, which can be inherited. Tags may also contain information relating to the original item base. Tags can be oppositional or synergistic. There may only be a certain number of tags on an item at once. Tags retain memories of what created that item, discouraging alchemical loops.<br><br>Other than bit tags are aesthetic tags, which, unlike bit tags, have a scale from 0 - 100 that determines how strongly an item inherits the traits associated with the tag. When two items are combined, the averages of tags is calculated, rounding down into whole numbers. Alchemizing an item with an item in its hereditary tree returns the same tag value. The more prominent a tag is, the more parts might be exchanged. Tags have aesthetic and form components, and perhaps materials affect things like weight and buoyancy, although minorly. As a tag gets higher or stronger, it gains secondary abilities, such as damage increases. Aspect tags are the important parts of this. Aspect tags will give an item an aspect power when strong enough.]]></description><link>alchemy.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Alchemy.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 21:38:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bits]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>A bit is one of 48 pieces of data represented by holes punched in an item card. These bits correspond to functional tags that, together, define the base functions of an item. An item with no bits is a Perfectly Generic Object, although an object with no bits may still have Aesthetic Tags. Bits are listed in no particular order.<br><br>Bits are still subject to change.<br><br>A bit set is able to define emergent properties of objects with certain combinations of bits. Below are some of the bit sets so far.<br><br>Bit sets are also, naturally, subject to change.]]></description><link>bits.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Bits.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 21:38:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Combat]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>A generated event involving at least one aggressor, one target, and a combat goal. Combat participation is optional. Combat will begin when initiated by a single party, and combatants involved will be assigned depending on various traits. See Combatant. Combat will not be restricted to Event Chunks, but will aim to fit within them. When an entity becomes Aware of an aggressor, they will be prompted to Strife or Abscond.<br><a data-href="The Fray" href="the-fray.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">The Fray</a> will inform how combat is approached by setting the pace and difficulty of a battle. The Fray will have both Tempo and Metre. Enemies will tend to attack on Meter, although they may have different Tempos. Swarmers will adjust the Speed of Tempo according to factional relationships. Commanders can set the Metre of Tempo for the Swarmers they lead, such as Waltz Time or Common Time. <br>Projectile weapons will use Ammo if available, but you can also get an upgrade to create Ammunition from your Grist stores. Projectile weapons only shoot when using piercing attacks. Directional attacks would be swinging the gun. (Edge case I got caught up on: A rocket launcher will shoot when using a non-directional attack. Projectiles can change course– But this would be described elsewhere, not determined actively by the player.) Imagine directly hitting someone vs happening to hit someone indirectly.<br><br>Recoil, knockback, slides, and more. Innate movement encompasses running, sprinting, jumping, crouching, and sliding… Satisfactory-style crouch bhopping is also innate. Niche movement abilities will be supported, but optional in the form of alchemized gear, including dashing. Special body parts such as wings would be considered gear for this purpose.<br><br>Every weapon has light, heavy, and special attacks.<br>
<br>Special attacks are used when weapons are not locked on to a target (reloads, special attacks, other misc actions) Uses your current movement to do a certain attack.
<br>Piercing attacks are from the camera forwards– IE, non directional movement. Imagine a sword jab vs an arced attack. Instead of calculating armor, you’re looking for weak points/unarmored points. 
<br>Light attacks (for projectiles, this is shooting), they’re always forward facing/ cannot be directional
<br>Heavy attacks will be directional. They can influence direction while attacking, unlike special attacks, which only account for direction, not change it.
<br>Combinations of bits will assign a weapon a strife specibus type, which thus determines the function of light/heavy/special attacks
<br><br>
<br>Directional Attacks- 27 variations (Forward, Backward, Left, Right, Up, Down, All Diagonals and Not Moving)
<br>Parts have Gel Viscosity that can be depleted to deal a crit. If a crit on a 0 GV part kills the target, a gib system will be activated.
<br>“Lock on” function will lock on to target closest to center of screen, prioritizing Boss &gt; Commander &gt; Swarmer
<br>Which hit box do you hit, and how close to the center of the hit box are you? 
<br>A directional attack is more likely to chop off vs a non directional attack, which is more likely to pierce through
<br>Armour and parts will have directional weak points, IE, a carapacian with an armored head would be more resistant to downward directional attacks.
<br><br><br>The Commander is, for all intents and purposes, a boss within a combat scenario. Because bosses will be diverse, the play style efficiency will depend on the boss. Commanders within an event chunk will have levels of importance. Lower importance means lower chances of successfully commanding a swarm. High importance increases likelihood of command success, but also… Commander tactics in battle will be determined by:<br>
<br>Genre (The Fray system)
<br>Personal Goals
<br>Politics
<br>Team Numbers or Ratios
<br><br>Swarmers will be the bulk of enemy teams. The Metre of Swarmers is controlled by the Commanders controlling them, although the Speed is usually dictated by Factional Relationship to PC. Swarmers will form clouds of AI groups. When in Combat, Swarmers will tend to group together. If a Commander is present, Swarmer AI will be dependent on Commander Tactics. Limited AI with seeded randomness<br>
<br>Imps do not carry items but will have mutations. Faction leader is the Denizen.
<br>Basilisks, Liches, Giclopses, Ogres
<br>Carapacians - Equipment loadouts AND mutations
<br>Consorts do not mutate without Commander Intervention. Carry items and equipment loadouts.
<br><br>Combat begins when both parties are aware of an encounter. Teams are generated depending on the initiate parties.<br><br>Key choice made by evaluation of enemies, factions, power, tempo, etc<br>Abjure - What’s the goal of abjuration?<br>
<br>Dialogue - Dialogue abjuration will involve a defensive playstyle and quick dialogue choices. The goal of this must also be determined, but it can usually be assumed the goal is non-violent resolution and higher relationship and factional relationship.
<br>Knockout - Goal of this is non-lethal defeat of enemies. Enemies will not be killed when defeated. This can be for a variety of tactical reasons.<br>
Abscond - Tactical escapes, enemies will give chase! What’s the best way to leave?
<br>Will the enemy type give chase? Are you a target?
<br>What abilities do enemies have compared to players? Teleports?
<br>Is there a team looking for you now? Will this affect factional relationships? Regular relationships? Increase importance?<br>
Strife - The goal is to kill, the question is how?
<br>Team Numbers - Are we outnumbered? By how much?
<br>Presence of Commanders - Will the commanders also be killed? (combat stance related,) Are the enemies organized or disorganized?
<br>Enemy types– What types of damage will be most effective?<br>
A combat event will conclude with an end condition, either the death of the aggressor party or target party, the satiation of the aggressor party (calmed) or the target party (spared), fleeing, knock-out
<br>Fleeing - Extra damage against fleeing targets
<br>Knocked Out - Attacks kill knocked out targets
<br><br>Teams are created on battle start, but are also dynamic within an event chunk. Team placement will depend on various factors, such as faction relationships, player relationships, strife choice, and targets of attack. <br>Combatants involved in a combat event will be determined by how many combatants are within the event chunk. The event chunk will read the Time value depending on the combatants within the chunk and their time-related abilities. When an event chunk contains no combatants that have time-related abilities, only the SCT time will be read.<br>
Teams will include aggressor parties and target parties initially, and each of these teams will have defined intents to kill.]]></description><link>combat.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Combat.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 21:38:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Beats]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>The Fray is a reactive timing system throughout the game, influencing other core mechanics, such as combat and dialogue. The Fray can be affected in or out of combat, and is the main system that the time aspect will interact with. The Fray is client-side, meaning that unless players are in the same battle, they will rarely interact with the same Fray.<br><br>Spaces of time in a Meter of Combat, used to measure if a player is keeping Rhythm with the Meter and Tempo of Combat. Light Attacks are Quarter Beats, Heavy Attacks are Half Beats, and Special Attacks are Full Beats. Dialogue options will also be composed of Beats. Length of Beats will shift to match a combatants individual Time Signature.<br><br>Our means of tracking how closely the player’s Beats match the Tempo and Time Signatures of a Meter. Keeping Rhythm does not require attacking exactly on the Beat of The Fray, but matching the Tempo is required to get a bonus to Mana Regeneration and bonus Gel Viscosity Damage<br><br>Having different Time Signatures within a single Meter is considered a Polyrhythm, as long as Tempo is matched to the overall 4/4 Rhythm of Combat, we can treat beats on Tempo as correct. A Polyrhythm audible in The Fray, denotes a battle for ownership over The Fray. <br><br>Fighting Off Rhythm serves the purpose of shifting control of The Fray. If you attack an opponent Off Rhythm, it can force them to respond in ways that shake them into fighting in a different Time Signature or Tempo than they would be when Controlling or Fighting In The Fray. The more an opponent fights Off Rhythm, the more they lose Control of The Fray. After reaching a certain threshold, this will transfer control to the next most Rhythmic combatant. This makes those who do not have a good sense of rhythm out of play still serve an important role in shaking up the battlefield.<br><br>The amount of Beats a combatant leans for in a Meter. Will reference their Genre and Goal. This means that combatants will TEND to fight on a beat unless fighting reactively or attempting to throw an opponent Off Rhythm.<br><br>The attacks non-player combatants will execute on Beats and how the Beats relate to the Time Signature and Tempo of The Fray. Personality traits and combat style can have an affect on Genre.<br><br>The speed of a Meter of Combat. Paced by the strongest fighter(s) as they Own The Fray. Desperation, intensity, difficulty, and proximity to a timespace chunk all correlate positively with Tempo. Tempo can also be increased during arguments, chases, or escapes.<br><br>The amount of a round of Combat, evenly split into Beats based on a Time Signature. Some characters will speak in certain Meters.<br><br>Midis provide a flexible and customizable way to add music.]]></description><link>the-fray.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">The Fray.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 21:38:44 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
